In this post, I want to give an intuitive understanding on its proof to illustrate why it constructs a set like that and what it is doing.
Jordan-Hahn decomposition states as follows,
Let $\nu$ be a signed measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. Then it has a decomposition \begin{equation}\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^- \end{equation} where \begin{equation} \nu^+(A) = \sup \{\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} \end{equation}\begin{equation} \nu^-(A) = \sup \{-\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} \end{equation} and both $\nu^+$ and $\nu^-$ are measure and one of them is a finite measure.</description></item><item><title>Solutions to problems in Hugo</title><link>https://zh-qifan.github.io/en/2022/10/08/problem-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zh-qifan.github.io/en/2022/10/08/problem-in-hugo/</guid><description>I start this new page to record the problems I meet when using Hugo.

1 Alignment problem in MathJax When I render the page locally, the aligned environment in Latex worked normally. But whe I published the page, all the lines in the aligned environment collapsed into one large line. This problem can be solved by using five backslashes which will be compiled as \\\ in Markdown (Why?</description></item><item><title>Why does Jackknife method works?</title><link>https://zh-qifan.github.io/en/2022/10/08/why-jackknife-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zh-qifan.github.io/en/2022/10/08/why-jackknife-work/</guid><description>In the Advanced Mathematical Statistics course in Spring AY21/22, we studied two popular model-free computational methods used in estimation: Jackknife and Bootstrap. Given $n$ observations $X_1,\cdots, X_n$ and a statistics $T_n$ as the estimation for unknown parameter $\theta$ (e.g. mean value and variance), the Jackknife method for bias estimation formulates as follows, \begin{equation} b_{JACK} = (n - 1)(\bar{T}_{n-1} - T_n) \end{equation} where $\bar{T}_{n-1} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n T_{n-1,i} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n T_{n-1}(X_1,\cdots,X_{i-1},X_{i+1},\cdots,X_n)$ represents the estimator generated by $n-1$ observations in our full dataset.</description></item></channel></rss>
